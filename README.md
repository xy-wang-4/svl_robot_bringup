# This is a forked repo with some modifications for Autoware and F1tenth project

Assume svl and autoware have been installed and configured.

# SVL Robot Bringup(This part is from the original repo)

`svl_robot_bringup` is a ROS2 package to assist with using [Nav2](https://navigation.ros.org/), the ROS 2 navigation stack, with the SVL Simulator.

The repository contains:
-  A ROS 2 node named `odom_tf_node` that subscribes to the `/odom` topic from the simulator and broadcasts the `tf` transform between the `basefootprint` and `odom` frames for the Cloi robot.
- A launch file which launches `odom_tf_node` as well as the `lgsvl_bridge` and the `pointcloud_to_laserscan` node and broadcasts a few static transforms for the sensor frames.
- A map of the LG Seocho environment available in the SVL Simulator to be used for localization and planning.
- Params for running Nav2.
- An rviz config file.

**Note**: this repository is currently only supported on ROS 2 Foxy.

# Update

New components added:

-  A urdf file for F1tenth
-  A map for racing environment
-  a slam_toolbox config file

# Remaining Issues
Currently, it is using GPS messages to publish /odom -> /base_link tf for simulation. 

(To do) use wheel odometry / imu. Will be updated later.

# SLAM(Mapping)

The simulated map was generated by [slam_toolbox](https://github.com/SteveMacenski/slam_toolbox).

To generate your own map using F1tenth vehicles, follow the instructions below.

# Instruction(Mapping)

mkdir -p svl_test/src

cd svl_test/src

git clone https://github.com/SteveMacenski/slam_toolbox

change line 4305 of Karto.h to following

'''

    m_NumberOfRangeReadings = static_cast<kt_int32u>(math::Round((GetMaximumAngle() -
      GetMinimumAngle()) /
